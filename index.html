        <h1><b>ABOUT ME</b></h1><br>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated and passionate third-year computer science engineering student with a solid foundation in coding, web development, cloud computing, and data structures. Throughout my academic journey, I've consistently excelled in coursework and projects, which have allowed me to apply and strengthen my technical skills.

I thrive in collaborative environments and have actively contributed to team projects that demand creativity and critical thinking. Working with peers has not only honed my technical abilities but also improved my communication and problem-solving skills. I believe in the power of teamwork to achieve remarkable results.

Beyond academics, I am deeply committed to staying culturally active and giving back to the community. I've had the privilege of organizing and leading coding workshops to introduce coding to beginners. This experience has not only sharpened my teaching skills but also fostered a sense of responsibility to share knowledge and empower others in the tech community.

As a daughter of a defense personnel, I've had the unique opportunity to adapt quickly to new environments and situations. This adaptability has been an invaluable asset in both my personal and academic life, allowing me to approach challenges with resilience and an open mind.

I am genuinely excited to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic organization that is dedicated to creating innovative solutions that positively impact society. My goal is to be a valuable asset in the pursuit of these solutions and to continue learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.

I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share my passion for technology and innovation. Let's collaborate and make a positive change together!
